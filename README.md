In CSE 310, Data Structures and Algorithms, emphasis is focused on advanced data structures and algorithms, including stacks, queues, trees (B, B+, AVL), graphs, as well as searching for graphs, hashing, external sorting.

In the Linked Lists folder, find a connect four game that utilizes linked lists to add each player to a leaderboard. Linked Lists and structs are used to add each player's information to the array. File input and output is additionally used to write the leaderboard to a file, and read it if available.

In the binary search tree folder, a 2-player connect four game was created. The player has the opportunity to 'rerun' the game which utilized sleep() to replay all of the moves made throughout the game. A BST is used to store the board after each move.
